# EVMPatch Developer Study

This repository contains the details of the developer study conducted in the
course of our paper *EVMPatch: Timely and Automated Patching of Ethereum Smart

collaboration of [NEC Labs Europe](http://www.neclab.eu) and [University of Duisburg-Essen](https://www.syssec.wiwi.uni-due.de/).
