# Study Files

The files in this directory were provided as part of the developer study to the
participants. We provided a Virtual Machine (based on Xubuntu 20.04) with all
necessary tools pre-installed (i.e., EVMPatch, Solidity, the Remix IDE and
go-ethereum).

* The developer study manual was provided to the developers (file:
    `./developer-study-manual.pdf`)
* A spreadsheet for submitting the answers (file: `./study_answers.ods`)
* The files for the tasks described in the manual (files: `./task_{1,2,3}/`)
